# Prediction-kidney-failure-using-Artificial-neural-network
We are using neural network model to predict the kidney failure. It is using the data taken from urine sample of the patients. The data consists of concentration of Urea, Creatinine, Sodium, Calcium, Phosphorus, Uric acid, and Potassium in urine sample of patient.
